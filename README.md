</h2><b> ABOUT PROJECT</b> </h2>

In this project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. As we move the cursor to various positions in the picture we will be able to know the different colours present at that exact position.Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and digital art apps.

</h2><b> DATASET </b> </h2>

Range of colours are made up of 3 primary colours red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each colour value within a range of 0 to 255.That is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In our dataset, we need to map each colorâ€™s values with their corresponding names.

The CSV file for our dataset has been taken from this link:
